# BBX Intent File - The TRUE .bbx format
# Semantic workflow compression: describe WHAT, not HOW
#
# This file is "compressed DevOps" - 10 lines that expand into
# a full deployment workflow with build, test, deploy, verify steps.

bbx: "2.0"
intent: "Deploy React application to AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN"

target: "frontend-app"
environment: "production"

constraints:
  - "no-downtime"
  - "cost < $20/month"
  - "must invalidate CDN cache"

hints:
  - "use docker for build"
  - "run tests before deploy"
  - "notify slack on completion"

# That's it. BBX expands this into a full workflow:
# 1. Finds similar successful deployments from memory (RAG)
# 2. Generates concrete steps using templates + LLM
# 3. Applies constraints (rolling deploy for no-downtime)
# 4. Executes the workflow
#
# Run: bbx intent run deploy.bbx
# Preview: bbx intent run deploy.bbx --dry-run
